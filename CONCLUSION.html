<P>The main goal of html is to be a universal language for classifying the function of different
sections of a document.In other words,HTML is used to define the different parts of your page.
You indicate which part of your document is a title,which part of your document is an address,
which part of your document should be emphasised,which part of your document should include
an image, and so forth.HTML is neither a page-layout language nor a printing language.The only
thing HTML does is classify parts of your documents so that a browser can display it correctly.
This allows documents to be displayed on many different kinds of platforms.Although html has 
evolved to the point that it contains many layouts and formatting commands,these functions are 
secondary to HTML's role in classifying the logical parts of your documents.

The important thing to remember is that HTML is designed to work on wide variety of platforms.
Not just ordinary personal-computers platformslike PCs and Macintoshes,but HTML is also
designed to work on a wide variety of graphical workstations,"dumb" terminals,network computers,
hand-held devices, and much more.

The idea behind HTMLis that if you mark up your document by indicating the parts of your document
by function then you should be anble to trust that your document will be attractively and
correctly displayed by any browser on any computer anywhere in the world.


This means that HTML can be used to put a document or not just computer screens,but also printers
fax machines,t.v sets,game consoles,Braille devices,digital watches, and text-to-speech machines,
Imagine,for e.g->a browser that  accepts input from the touch-tone buttons on a telephone, and
then reads a WEB page back to you over the phone.

Ultimately is a language which helps us to create a web pages,which can be registered on INTERNET
so that everyone would be able to view our sites.
